​CrOSSD's platform implementation - fully available as open source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/FH-CrOSSD) - is designed with scalability and portability in mind. Leveraging Kubernetes clusters, our system can flexibly deploy multiple components, including crawlers and metric calculators, across various nodes. The data collection process is orchestrated by a Celery Task Queue, ensuring regular scans of repositories and seamless task allocation to crawler containers. Our system currently supports two types of crawlers: Type 1, which utilizes the GitHub REST API, and Type 2, predominantly using the GraphQL interface. All gathered data is stored in a distributed ArangoDB database. Additionally, diverse metric calculation containers produce results stored within the database. This robust architecture forms the backbone of CrOSSD's functionality.

Now, let's take a closer look at the intuitive web interface available at [health.crossd.tech](https://health.crossd.tech/):

Homepage: Upon entering the CrOSSD web interface, users are greeted with a clean and intuitive homepage. It provides quick access to project search functionality and displays general statistics of indexed data, giving users an immediate overview of the platform's capabilities.

Project Overview: Upon selecting a project of interest, users are presented with a comprehensive overview of its health metrics from the latest scan. The interface features a dropdown menu to access metrics from different scan instances, enabling users to track changes over time and make informed decisions.

Metric Details: Clicking on individual metrics reveals detailed descriptions and definitions, along with graphical representations of historical metric values across all scan instances. This feature empowers users to delve deeper into specific metrics and gain actionable insights into project health.
