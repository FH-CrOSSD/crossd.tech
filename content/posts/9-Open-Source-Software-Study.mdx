Do you regularly work with or develop open-source software? Then we would love to talk to you!

We are conducting research on how people think about OSS quality and how they evaluate OSS projects. We want to interview people to gather all kinds of perspectives. Whether you encounter OSS in the context of freelance work, working at startups or larger companies, as a tinkerer and hobbyist, or in connection with education, research or teaching â€“ come talk to us!

The interview will be conducted online and should take about 45 minutes. If interested, please contact [lklausner@fhstp.ac.at](mailto\:lklausner@fhstp.ac.at). Thank you in advance! :)
