      CrOSSD is a research project that aims to identify important and critical
      open source software projects and measure their current "health" through
      automated analyses.&#x20;


      Open source software (OSS) is used in countless companies and public
      agencies, however, there is currently no efficient way to view or
      automatically check the health of OSS. The aim of CrOSSD is to assess the
      status quo regarding the "health" of (especially: critical) OSS projects.
      "Health" is to be defined by various metrics (including stability,
      resilience, security and compliance).&#x20;


      #### How does it work?


      Quantitative & qualitative metrics are to be applied:


      * *Quantitative & automated:* Crawling of meta-information (e.g.
      contributors, commits, activity), analysis of dependencies.

      * *Qualitative:* sustainability/funding, activity indicators, security
      policies, etc.&#x20;


      The result of the project is a platform that offers monitoring and
      evaluation of the metrics of a corpus of OSS projects.
