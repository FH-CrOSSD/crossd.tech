# CrOSSD - Towards a Critical Open-Source Software Database
Open-Source-Software (OSS) is used in countless (domestic) companies and public institutions; however, currently, there is no efficient way to assess or automatically check the health status of OSS. In CrOSSD, we are building a database that can identify important and critical projects and measure their current status through partially automated analyses. OSS "health" is defined by various metrics (including stability, resilience, and security).
